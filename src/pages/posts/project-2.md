<!-- The following was a UX course final project, and still something I hope to make real one day... :)

## Research

To come up with a product idea I started with the persona I was trying to help. At the time, quite a few of of my friends and coworkers had become first-time parents, and I wanted to tackle a problem that would help the chaotic lives of full-time working moms. 

I scheduled as many interview sessions as a could to try to get a full picture of what a daily routine was like and what challenges had surfaced since having kids.

Over the course of these interviews, some common themes arose.

1. **Every moment of the day is scheduled (“There’s no such thing as free time”)**
  -dinners, school, play dates, cleaning, diapers, doctors, WORK

2. **Responsibilities are handed off between parents from day to day**
  -One parent might pick up the kid from school one day an the other drop them off the next. If there's a form that needs to be signed and returned that hand-off has to happen.

3. **Managing order of operations is essential to getting things done**
  -If the dishwasher isn't run the night before, Mom won't have her pumping equipment for work the next morning

4. **You’re caring for a small, increasingly autonomous human**
  -So nothing ever "goes as planned."

Pervading all of this, though, was perhaps the most important insight: **How does this work when you take the emotions of a relationship into account?**

The mental burden of "Managers of the household" -  https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/

This was a colossal problem to tackle. But one very worth it!

## Goals

A way to easily track and share everything that needs to get done

Relief from some of the mental and emotional burden of managing a shared household

Less time organizing and more quality time spent with the family

## Some early trials and lessons learned

-timeline with entered schedules with pings and overdues and OMG no that would be so much work and so stressful

It seemed inspired and by the first concept testing session completely invalidated.

What if the "organization" aspect could take place naturally within the flow of communication?
How might a tool smartly predict tasks and do that work for them. 
How can tasks be shared without one parent telling the other what to do.

A messaging app!
